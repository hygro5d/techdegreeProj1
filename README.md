# TREEHOUSE TECHDEGREE PROJECT 1 - Random Quote Generator 
My first techdegree project with 'Exceeds Expectations' attempt. 
For this project I created an app in Javascript to construct a random quote generator. My code consist of,
- an array of quote objects with additional properties.
- 3 functions: one that produces a random quote from the array, one to send the generated quotes to be displayed in a HTML string and one to make the background colour change with each new quote generated. 
I also attempted to complete all 3 extra credit items.
